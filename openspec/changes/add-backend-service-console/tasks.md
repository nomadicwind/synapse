## Tasks
- [x] **Design Console APIs & Auth**
  - [x] Provide env-driven token guard for `/internal/console/*`
  - [x] Document required env vars (e.g., `CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, `VITE_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, `CONSOLE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`)
- [x] **Implement Health & Metrics Endpoints**
  - [x] Add FastAPI routes that aggregate API/Worker/STT health plus Redis/PostgreSQL/MinIO connectivity checks
  - [x] Expose Celery queue depth and worker heartbeat metadata through a metrics endpoint
- [x] **Knowledge Item Operations**
  - [x] Build paginated listing API filtered by `status` with detail view (timestamps, error logs)
  - [x] Implement “retry capture” action that resets `status` to `pending`, updates `processed_at`, and re-enqueues the proper Celery task
- [x] **Console UI**
  - [x] Create a secured dashboard UI (React + Vite app) with cards for health states, queue charts, and knowledge-item table
  - [x] Add alert banners + notifications when thresholds fail, and lightweight log tail viewer
- [x] **Knowledge Items Page**
  - [x] Split knowledge-item management into its own route/page that supports paging, filtering, detail view, and retry actions independent of the main dashboard
- [x] **Knowledge Item Editing**
  - [x] Add console UI controls to edit approved fields (title, status, last_error) with optimistic updates and backend validation
  - [x] Extend console APIs to persist edits securely (audit log TBD)
- [x] **Validation & Docs**
  - [x] Add pytest coverage for new endpoints/actions and mocked Celery interactions
  - [x] Document console usage in `README.md` / `STARTUP_GUIDE.md`
